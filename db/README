When installing e9_base one of the initial steps is to create the baseline
migration for the engine's database structure.

However there's currently no clean method to "upgrade" an app with a newer
version of the e9_base gem where the database may have changed.  

Beginning with v1.3.2 the strategy will be to wrap up the current schema in a
baseline migration each time a database change is introduced to the engine, in
this way if you are upgrading from say version 1.3.2 to 1.3.3, you'd need to
apply all database migrations in the archive/v1.3.3 folder (excluding the 
"baseline" which is simply the full schema at the point v1.3.3 was begun).
