    Conrad cut his teeth as a lead internet strategist in Silicon Alley. Fresh 
    from Drexel, this competitive, all-star ice hockey player worked for others, 
    directing projects for start-ups and big corporations like Sumitomo and Lehman 
    Brothers.

    But Conrad wanted to leverage his successes &mdash; and his mistakes &mdash; 
    into solving problems for his own clients. In 2001, he founded and ran a 
    successful software development company which he sold in 2006. A year later, 
    e9digital was born.

    At e9digital, Conrad's role is to help businesses grow. He oversees all client 
    relationships, and helps identify and realize their strategic online marketing 
    needs.

    &ldquo;I live, eat, and breathe developing websites. I love sitting in my 
    sunlit loft office in New York, and watching as our work makes a real-world 
    impact on our clients, and their businesses,&rdquo; he says. Conrad lives in 
    New York.
